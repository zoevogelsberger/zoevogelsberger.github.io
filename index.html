        <p class="lead mb-4">There are many birthday parties in this world that lack that certain touch. You can have cake, presents, friends and family… but isn't there something that you’re forgetting? That’s right, at the heart of every astonishing birthday party lies the crown jewel that is a party clown. With unbridled joy and whimsy, the mere presence of a fun-loving clown is enough to bring upon the widest smile on anyone's face.<br><br>

        Silliness is what I do. My life revolves around the joy of others. And it just so happens that the need for such joy is something that society needs; and will happily pay for. I had a happy life growing up, always consuming media and looking for something fun to engage with. Being a collector of many toys and games, it wasn’t hard to gain many new friends through my young life. All around me were smiles, faces and laughter. Making others laugh was the highlight of my day, I truly couldn’t get enough! As the years went on and as the world changed around me, I never stopped doing what I was best at. New friends, new environments, new comedy. My reputation was glorious and inspiring. It was at moments like these where I knew what the world needed me for. Who else around was going to bring joy to the people if not I? Who else would possess the powerful ability to turn that frown upside down? It became clearer and clearer in my mind what my purpose in life was, and here I am today.<br><br>

        In my years of clowning, I soon became known of the many skills one must juggle in this field of work; juggling included! The art of the clown isn’t just for one age range as most would think. In order to truly hone your ability, you must learn to adapt alongside all ages! The people need accessible humor, no matter who, so it was important to me that I master the fine art of clowning. I started out small, having people book my service for local birthday bashes in the area, really starting to make a name for myself. Everyone adored it, couldn't get enough of it! What started as small and humble beginnings slowly and surely grew to sudden heights. I had to start planning trips to parties far, far away that needed me. Demands for me in different states! Different countries! With my practice, I became a world-renowned clown, a global icon for joy! I am now thoroughly fulfilled and happy in life. I am next scheduled to perform in front of the president himself. But some might think, “How is this possible? How can you be so rich and famous from THAT?” And I think to myself, “Fame and fortune can’t possibly be my end goal.” No, my currency is much more different to the common eye. For the smiles and laughter of the masses is plentiful enough to purchase even the most expensive thing in the whole world!
